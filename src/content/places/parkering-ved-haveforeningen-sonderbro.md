# Parkering ved Haveforeningen Sønderbro - Free Long Term Parking

A valuable find in Copenhagen where parking can be both expensive and scarce - a free long-term parking spot that's perfect for visitors staying in the city for extended periods.

## The Location

Located on Bonderostien in Østerbro, this parking area offers the rare opportunity to park for free without time restrictions. The neighborhood is well-connected to the city center via public transport and cycling routes.

## Getting There

Østerbro is easily accessible by bike or public transport from central Copenhagen. The area maintains a more residential character while still being close to the city's main attractions.

## What Makes It Special

In a city where paid parking is the norm, finding free long-term parking is like discovering a hidden gem. This spot is particularly valuable for:
- **Weekend trips**: Park Friday and retrieve Monday
- **Extended visits**: No hourly fees to worry about
- **Budget travel**: Save money for experiences instead of parking

## Important Notes

Always check current parking regulations and signs, as city parking rules can change. What makes this spot special today is its current status as free long-term parking - but it's wise to verify before leaving your vehicle for extended periods.
