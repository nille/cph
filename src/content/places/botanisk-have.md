# Botanisk Have

Copenhagen's Botanical Garden offers a peaceful green oasis right in the heart of the city. This beautiful garden provides the perfect escape for picnics, leisurely walks, or simply enjoying nature without leaving the central area.

## What Makes It Special

The location in central Copenhagen makes Botanisk Have incredibly valuable as an urban green space. You can easily incorporate a visit into a day of city exploration, providing a natural break from museums, shopping, and sightseeing.

## Free Access

One of the best features of Botanisk Have is that you don't have to pay to enter the garden itself - only the museum requires an entrance fee. This makes it an accessible green space for everyone to enjoy, regardless of budget.

## Perfect for Picnics

The garden's layout and peaceful atmosphere make it ideal for picnics. Bring food from one of Copenhagen's many excellent food markets or cafes and enjoy it surrounded by beautiful plants and landscaping.

## Important Note

Be mindful that dogs are not allowed in the park. This policy helps maintain the tranquil atmosphere and protects the botanical collections, but it's important to plan accordingly if you're traveling with a four-legged companion.

## Getting There

Located in Indre By, Botanisk Have is easily accessible from anywhere in central Copenhagen. Its central location makes it perfect for a spontaneous visit during a day of exploring the city center.
