      <p>
        Copenhagen became home in a way I didn't expect. What started as curiosity about a city known for design, cycling, and hygge evolved into a deep appreciation for the subtle rhythms that make this place special.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide isn't about the Copenhagen everyone knows—though those famous spots earn their reputation. Instead, it's about the Copenhagen that revealed itself through longer stays: the quiet corners where locals pause, the seasonal changes that transform familiar streets, and the small discoveries that accumulate into genuine affection for a place.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Explore</h2>

      <p>
        My approach to the city is deliberately slow. I prefer walking to metros, return to places across different seasons, and value quality over quantity. A single afternoon spent properly in one neighborhood teaches you more than a rushed tour of ten attractions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each recommendation here represents multiple visits, different times of day or year, and the kind of familiarity that comes from becoming a regular rather than just a visitor.
      </p>

      <h2>What You'll Find</h2>

      <p>
        These aren't reviews in the traditional sense. They're more like letters to friends, sharing what I've discovered and why it matters. I focus on places that have something distinctive to offer—whether that's exceptional coffee, thoughtful design, or simply an atmosphere that makes you want to linger.
      </p>

      <p>
        The selections reflect my own interests: quiet spaces, good coffee, thoughtful design, and experiences that connect you to the city's character rather than just checking items off a list.
      </p>

      <h2>Using This Guide</h2>

      <p>
        Copenhagen is a city that rewards patience and attention. Use this guide as a starting point, but leave room for your own discoveries. The best experiences often happen when you're not looking for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most importantly, remember that any guide—including this one—reflects one person's perspective at a particular time. Your Copenhagen will be different from mine, and that's exactly as it should be.
