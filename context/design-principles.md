# Design Principles

## I. Core Design Philosophy & Strategy

* **Users First**

  * Prioritize real user needs and workflows.
  * For developer-facing tools: optimize developer experience (DX) with clarity and speed.
  * For consumer-facing flows: emphasize trust, simplicity, and ease.

* **Meticulous Craft**

  * Polish every detail: alignment, spacing, icons, micro-interactions.
  * Treat error states, loading, and edge cases as first-class design.

* **Simplicity & Clarity**

  * Reduce cognitive load. Interfaces should feel obvious, not explained.
  * Use plain language; avoid jargon. Labels should read as instructions.

* **Focus & Efficiency**

  * One primary action per view, clearly distinguished.
  * Default to workflows that minimize clicks, taps, and decisions.

* **Consistency**

  * Apply a single design language across all modules.
  * Consistent placement, naming, and patterns reduce relearning.

* **Opinionated Defaults**

  * Provide strong, helpful defaults.
  * Convention over configuration: users can override, but shouldn’t have to.

* **Accessibility (WCAG AA+)**

  * Meet or exceed AA contrast ratios.
  * Full keyboard operability, focus states, ARIA landmarks/labels.
  * Never rely on color alone for meaning.

* **Performance & Speed**

  * Design for perceived speed: skeletons, instant feedback.
  * Lightweight assets, responsive interactions.

* **Brand Identity Integration**

  * Subtly reflect brand personality in colors, typography, and micro-copy.
  * Keep usability primary; brand expression supports, not overshadows.

## II. Design System Foundation

* **Colors**

  * Single source of truth for brand, neutral, semantic, and accent palettes.
  * Document light + dark variants.
  * Define usage rules (e.g. only one primary per screen).

* **Typography**

  * Tokens for headings, body, small text, and monospace.
  * Limit weights to Regular / Medium / SemiBold / Bold.
  * Maintain readable line lengths and generous line-height.

* **Spacing & Layout**

  * Base unit (8px recommended).
  * Use multiples consistently for padding, margins, and grid gutters.

* **Border Radii**

  * Small set of radii tokens: sm (4px), md (6px), lg (8px), pill (full).
  * Reused across all components for unity.

* **Core Components**

  * Buttons, inputs, selects, checkboxes/radios, switches.
  * Cards, tables, modals, tooltips, navigation.
  * Badges, alerts, toasts, progress indicators.
  * Each defined with states (default, hover, active, focus, disabled).

## III. Layout, Visual Hierarchy & Structure

* **Responsive Grid**

  * 12-column system; adapt from mobile to wide desktop.
  * Max content width for readability (\~720–840px for text).

* **White Space**

  * Use space as a structural tool, not filler.
  * Prefer space over borders for grouping.

* **Hierarchy**

  * Headings and font weights guide attention.
  * Primary action styled as brand; secondary actions subdued.

* **Alignment**

  * Consistent left alignment for text and form fields.
  * Numeric data right-aligned in tables.

* **Navigation**

  * Predictable global navigation (top bar or sidebar).
  * Active state always visible.
  * Breadcrumbs for depth; clear section titles.

* **Mobile First**

  * Collapse complex structures (tables → cards).
  * Large tap targets (≥44px).
  * Avoid hover-dependent interactions.

---

## IV. Interaction & Animation Principles

* **Micro-interactions**

  * Purposeful, not decorative.
  * Provide immediate visual feedback (hover, press, focus).

* **Animation Timing**

  * Short and smooth: 150–250ms.
  * Easing: ease-in-out for most transitions.

* **Loading & Feedback**

  * Skeleton screens for page loads.
  * Spinners or inline loaders for small actions.
  * Toasts or inline alerts for success/error.

* **Transitions**

  * Animate state changes (dropdowns, modals, accordions).
  * Smooth reordering in lists/tables.

* **Keyboard & Screen Reader**

  * Every interactive element accessible via Tab/Enter/Space.
  * Focus trap inside modals; ESC closes.

* **Reduced Motion**

  * Honor user settings; provide non-animated equivalents.

## V. Module-Specific Guidance

### Multimedia Moderation

* Large previews, content first.
* Clear, color-coded approve/reject buttons with text + icons.
* Batch actions and keyboard shortcuts for efficiency.
* Metadata visible but secondary.
* Undo/confirmation for destructive actions.
* Dark mode option to reduce fatigue.

### Data Tables

* Readable row height, legible text.
* Bold headers, sortable columns, clear hover state.
* Filters and search above table.
* Pagination (default) or infinite scroll with indicators.
* Row actions consistently placed.
* Empty state messages/illustrations.

### Configuration Panels

* Logical grouping into sections or tabs.
* Clear labels, helper text/tooltips.
* Progressive disclosure for advanced options.
* Proper input types per data type.
* Real-time or inline feedback on save/error.
* Reset to defaults option.
* Danger zone isolated and styled distinctly.

## VI. CSS & Styling Architecture

* **Tokenized System**

  * Colors, typography, spacing, radius defined centrally.
  * Applied consistently across all components.

* **Methodology**

  * Utility-first, BEM, or CSS-in-JS — but consistent.
  * Low specificity, class-driven styling.

* **Maintainability**

  * Component-scoped styles.
  * Regular audits for unused CSS.
  * Minified & optimized builds.

* **Performance**

  * Async load non-critical CSS.
  * Self-host fonts with `font-display: swap`.

---

## VII. General Best Practices

* **Iterative Testing**

  * Regular user testing.
  * Iterate based on observed friction points.

* **Information Architecture**

  * Organize navigation logically.
  * Group related features.
  * Keep menus concise.

* **Error & Edge Case Design**

  * Friendly, actionable error messages.
  * Thoughtful empty states with guidance and CTAs.
  * Handle long text, missing images, unusual data gracefully.

* **Security & Privacy UX**

  * Mask sensitive data by default.
  * Confirm destructive actions.
  * Clear “danger zone” separation.

* **Consistent Tone**

  * Human, concise, action-oriented copy.
  * Errors specific and supportive.
  * Onboarding guidance approachable, not overwhelming.

* **Documentation & Self-Help**

  * Contextual help links in app.
  * Maintain external docs/help center.
  * Update design system docs alongside code.

* **Living System**

  * Style guide and principles updated as product evolves.
  * Feedback loop with designers/developers for improvements.
