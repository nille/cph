# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Astro-based static site for Copenhagen recommendations with a soft pastel color palette inspired by Miami art deco aesthetics.

## Development Commands

Development commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (localhost:4321)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run Astro CLI commands
npm run astro -- <command>
```

## Architecture

- **Framework**: Astro 5.x with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4.x (configured via Vite plugin) with custom pastel color palette
- **Content Management**: Astro Content Collections with Zod schema validation
- **Typography**: Courgette (headings) + Libre Baskerville (body)
- **Interactive Map**: Leaflet.js for location mapping

### Key Directories

- `src/content/recommendations/` - Markdown files for places, events, and tips recommendations
- `src/content/config.ts` - Content collection schema (defines required frontmatter fields)
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - Main layout template
- `src/pages/` - Route pages including dynamic `[slug].astro` for recommendations
  - `places.astro` - All location-based content (caf√©s, restaurants, museums, parks)
  - `events.astro` - Cultural events, festivals, exhibitions
  - `tips.astro` - Tips & tricks for Copenhagen living
  - `map.astro` - Interactive map showing all locations
  - `about.astro` - About page (not in main navigation)

### Content Schema

Recommendations must include frontmatter with:
- `title`, `category` (places|events|tips), `type`, `location`, `description`
- `rating` (1-5), `visited` (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Optional: `address`, `coordinates` (lat/lng for map), `neighborhood`, `season`, `tags`, `price_range`

## Design Principles

The site follows a soft Miami art deco aesthetic with gentle pastel colors and clean typography. Features a custom color palette with mint green (#d0f4de), rose pink (#ff99c8), sky blue (#a9def9), lavender (#e4c1f9), and warm cream (#fcf6bd) backgrounds. Clean typography hierarchy with Courgette script font for headers and Libre Baskerville serif for body text. Navigation uses diamond separators and subtle underline hover effects.

## Development Notes

- TypeScript is configured with Astro's strict preset
- Markdown supports drafts and uses 'min-light' syntax highlighting
- Content collections provide type safety for recommendation data
- All styling should use TailwindCSS classes following the existing design system
